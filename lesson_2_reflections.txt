What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It becomes a git repo.  If it isn't done, then it's not a repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

the working directory is on the computer and is where the files live whereas the staging area is where files are put before being committed.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

run diff --staged and notice what has been added.


What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Branches would be helpful when making test changes, performing experiments, or other things where keeping a main branch
while working a separate branch would make sense.  Branches allow changes to be made and then possibly merged at a later time.
