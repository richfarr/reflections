Diff allows one to see the differences between files within their context.  That is, diff shows lines before and after a difference and the difference itself.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It's easier than saving different documents with different names.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

Manually choosing lets the user choose when to commit and the user is metter able to determine what should constitite a commit.  Automatic commits are good in that you'll never forget a commit but they may be done at the most inopportune time.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Git kind of over does the commits but it's better to be safe than sorry.  I believe that diffs between files are very small so there's no reason not to do many commits.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log will give the user an overview of the changes whereas git diff will show the actual changes which were made.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
if a bug is introduced, it's easy to undo it at this point.
